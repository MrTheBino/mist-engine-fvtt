# Legend In The Mist - MistEngine for FoundryVTT

![Foundry v13](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v13-green)

This is an unoffical system implementation of the MIST Engine from Son Of Oaks for FoundryVTT.

Currently it only supports Legend In The Mist.


**This system is not yet usable!**

## Why another system?

I like simplicity in FoundryVTT systems because I love it to prepare my sessions in Foundry. So, a fast way to prepare my sessions is my primary goal.
This system implementation is focused on entering adversaries, npcs and characters in a fast and easy way.


This system uses at present code snippets and graphics from the City of Mist HUD module.
