## Tags & Status Markdown

You can use these formatting in almost every text field to display a MIST engine style tag or status

    [tag] - a simple tag
    [status-1] - a status with tier 1, tier 1-6
    [/s status] - a status without a tier, usage in a journal for example
    [/sg status-2] - a status with a green color instead of yellow
    [/w weakness] - a weakness tag, usage in text and compendiums for example
    [/wo weakness] - a weakness tag in orange, usage in text and compendiums for example
