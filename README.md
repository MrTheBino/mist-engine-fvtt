## Why another system?

I like simplicity in FoundryVTT systems because I love it to prepare my sessions in Foundry. So, a fast way to prepare my sessions is my primary goal.
This system implementation is focused on entering adversaries, npcs and characters in a fast and easy way.


This system uses at present code snippets and graphics from the City of Mist HUD module.
