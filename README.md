# Legend In The Mist - MistEngine for FoundryVTT

![Foundry v13](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v13-green) [![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/MrTheBino/mist-engine-fvtt/total.svg)]()

This is an unoffical system implementation of the MIST Engine from Son Of Oaks for FoundryVTT.

Currently it only supports Legend In The Mist.


**This system is in ALPHA stage.**

## Features

* NPC / Adversary sheet
* Character sheets
* backpack, themebooks, fellowship relationships for character sheets
* milestone, abandon,improve, promises development markers
* quick, detailed and reaction rolls
* burning power tags
* using weekness tags
* scene window dialog for handing scene and story markers / tags (found in the left sidebar under Journal Notes > Scene Tags)
* temporary statuses for characters and npcs
* enclose tags with [] in text forms, eg. [super cool] or [burning-3]
  
## ToDo

- shared fellowship themebook / cards


If using weekness tags, you have to improve / mark the themebook manually. There is no automation for this in the system.

## Manifest-URL for manual installation of the system

## Why another system?

I like simplicity in FoundryVTT systems because I love it to prepare my sessions in Foundry. So, a fast way to prepare my sessions is my primary goal.
This system implementation is focused on entering adversaries, npcs and characters in a fast and easy way.


This system uses at present code snippets and graphics from the City of Mist HUD module.
